# US Home Prices Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of key factors influencing US home prices over the last 20 years. The S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index is used as a proxy for home prices. The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), modeling, and results documentation.

## Repository Structure

- **`EDA.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis. This notebook includes data cleaning, visualization, and preliminary insights.
- **`Modeling.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for building and evaluating machine learning models to understand the impact of various factors on home prices.
- **`house.py`**: Python script containing data processing code used in the analysis.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python packages for running the notebooks and scripts.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation file providing an overview of the project.
- **`LICENSE`**: License file specifying the terms of use for this repository.
- **`Summary.pdf`**: Detailed report summarizing the findings and insights from the analysis.
- **`eda.pdf`**: PDF version of the Exploratory Data Analysis notebook.
